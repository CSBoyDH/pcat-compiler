The TA failed to offer enough information and supplimentary materials
so we must search for it manually.


A [similar course](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/syllabus.html) 
with project on PCAT was offered by 
[Prof. Harry H.Porter](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/) in 2005.
Although in Java without solution, its supplimentary materials
as well as lectures closely linked to the PCAT compiler, still means a lot
to us.
