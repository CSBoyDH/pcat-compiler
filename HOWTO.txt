How to configure?
    Locate routine_prefix at begining of gen.c
    set it to "_" or "" according to the manner in which your gcc treat function symbol
        e.g.  "_func" or "func" for subroutine named "func"

How to compile?
    $ make 

How to run?
    $ ./parser /path/to/file.pcat  # pcat -> asm
    $ ./compile                    # asm  -> native code e.g. ./exe (linux) or ./exe.exe (cygwin)
    $ ./exe                        # run
